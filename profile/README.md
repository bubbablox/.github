> Thanks everyone for helping us continue this journey. BubbaBlox has shut down, for good. The code is open sourced at [harryzawg/bubbablox-v2](https://github.com/harryzawg/bubbablox-v2). We will not help you with the source code.
>
> We have lost motivation into BubbaBlox because of the latest things, I honestly think it was reaching it's end.
>
> You can find another shut down message in our [website](https://bbblox.org)
